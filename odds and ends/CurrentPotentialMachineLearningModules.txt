## main dataset
- drops everything that is more than 20% empty 
- drop all false positive flags 
- drop kep_ID
- set KOI_Name to index 


## 1 machine learning
Data set would need to:
- trying to find Exoplanet_Archive_Disposition
- drop false positive flags
- drop canidates in Exoplanet_Archive_Disposition
Machine learning module with portion of confirmed and false positive data to see if we can accurately guess rest of data

## 2 machine learning 
Data set would need to:
- same thing as #1
- instead test with all confirmed and positive data
machine learning module to see if machine learning module can "guess" confirmed or false positve for "canidate" data 


## 3 machine learning 
- trying to calcuate disposition_scores
- drop Exoplanet_Archive_Disposition and  Disposition_Using_Kepler_Data
- drop false positive flags 
Machine learning module to see if machine learning can accurately guess disposition_Scores
? i dont believe we would need to get rid of canidates for this one, but not sure

## 4 machine learning ?
- trying to calculate which planets are habitable 
- add a column for habitable planets
- ? this one might be more difficult do do a machine learning module. it is calculated by ( 0.5 < Planet Radius ≤ 1.6 Earth radii or 0.1 < Planet Minimum Mass ≤ 3 Earth masses)(conservative) or  (i.e. 1.6 < Planet Radius ≤ 2.5 Earth radii or 3 < Planet Minimum Mass ≤ 10 Earth masses)
- ? we could easily put together our list of potentional habitable planets, but with only 20-40 out of 9,000+ planets, this might not be the best for machine learning. Maybe just a graph an one dedicated slide and move on
