                At the beginning of this data exploration, we set out to answer two questions: 1. could we use
                machine learning to automate planet findings? and 2. How many planets in NASA's Kepler dataset are
                potentially habitable? Here we summarize how we fared in answering these questions.

                The simple answer to whether machine learning can be used to automate planet findings is yes, however, it is way more complex of a question than that. Our machine learning model can predict whether a transit event is a planet up to about 88% accurary or roughly prediciting 641 transit events correctly out of 725. This is a rather remarkable percent accuracy given how random and sporatic transit events can be, but unforuntaly, this is not accurate enough to be applicable to NASA's tranist event analysis. Right now NASA has a Machine Learning Model called the Exominer and their recall is 93% with a fixed percision value of 0.99. There model also works the same with the TESS set of exoplanets where as ours is untested on TESS. The ideal model for this case would be a model with 99% recall so that it could be assumed that anything the model rejects isn't a planet and allow the data scientists to look at a much smaller section of the data. If this was true for our limited analysis of 7,247 transit events, This would effectively reduce the analysis time by 66% for NASA data scientists. Because this model is only reading at 88% recall, it is too unreliable for the classification of transit events.

                <h5 style="color:white">
                As for habitability, even though our analysis found that only 1.8% of all planets are potentially habitable
                by the most optimistic criteria, that number may initially seem high. If up to 1.5% of all planets are 
                habitable, that suggests that extraterrestrial life would be common in a galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars, 
                but remember, these potentially habitable planets don't necessarily have life nor are they necessarily habitable. 
                They merely haven't been disqualified from habitability based on their temperature and radius. To add further 
                perspective, Mars, an as-far-as-we-know lifeless and inhospitable rock meets with an average temperature of 
                210 Kelvin and a radius of .53 earth radii.

                <h5 style="color:white">
                Even though NASA's Kepler mission has ended, there are several active planet-finding missions using 
                similar technology including the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Machine learning algorithms 
                like ours could potentially be adapted for these ongoing missions.
