    On this page we could have a scatterplot of exoplanets with the size corresponding to the planet's size, color corresponding to planet temperature and a hover feature that gives likelihood of habitability

    Then we could have a dropdown menu of the planets which would bring up a datafield on the planet and a gauge meter showing how habitable it is.
